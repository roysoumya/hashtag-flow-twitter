# hashtag-flow-twitter
Contains the codebase for the Social Computing Term Project, Autumn 2017 IIT Kharagpur. The name of our project is "Prediction of hashtag flow in Twitter" and the team comprised of Avirup Saha, Soumyadeep Roy, Srinidhi Moodalagiri, Kushal Gaikwad, Abhay Shukla.  The final presentation slides are provided "DL Term Project presentation.pdf".


# Description
In general, the popularity of a hashtag depends on the two primary factors : 
1. hashtag tweet reinforcement
2. hashtag-hashtag competition

Through this term project, we propose the following approaches : 
1. Linear memory less (LMM) which is a novel approach that relies on hashtag-tweet reinforcement.
2. SeqGAN model (as described in Yu et. al. 2017) which explicitly models inter-hashtag competition.

# Event Detection
There are two steps to run this code:

### Preprocessing: 


# Coding environment
Python 3.6.4
