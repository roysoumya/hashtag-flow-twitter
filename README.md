Contains the codebase for the Social Computing Term Project, Autumn 2017 IIT Kharagpur

# Description
This work is a part of my Deep Learning Term Project of Spring, 2018 titled "Event Extraction and Coreferencing". My other team members are : Avirup Saha and Gourab Kumar Patro. The final presentation slides are provided "DL Term Project presentation.pdf".

# Event Detection
There are two steps to run this code:

### Preprocessing: 
using file data_script.py and encode_window.py You will need to have the ACE 2005 data set in the format required by this file. We cannot include the data in this release due to licence issues.

The dataset given to us is in xml format. We made major changes in the data_script.py and ed_train.py file. Contain 38 event.subtypes

Train and test the model: using file ed_train.py

# Coding environment
Python 3.6.4

numpy 1.14.2

tensorflow 1.6.0
